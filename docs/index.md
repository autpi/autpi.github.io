# ModCS

This is the site for the documentation of **AutPI ModCS**, a Cave Story modding lua scripting API.
It allows you to make custom hud elements, easily modify and make NPCs, create custom weapons and
create custom TextScript commands.

This project originally was developed by aikyuu and yasinbread, and the original site for ModCS
is now currently out-of-date with the new features that have been added since -- as this project is now a freeware dll for the original game, rather than CSE2-based.

If you're looking for the original standalone ModCS documentation, it is [here](https://modcavestory.github.io). The documentation for AutPI won't be entirely the same!

The current day of ModCS would not be the same without their hard work, so thank them for the creation of this tool!
